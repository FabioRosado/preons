## Config all the CSS properties

My thinking is, if I create a config of all CSS property names (or at least the most used ones), it's not that difficult to map preons into a fully fledge utility library.

Therefore, different companies, teams and people can use the functional class syntax that they are most comfortable with.

As I'm probably not making any sense, here's an example.

CSS Property Names (some):

- margin-left
- margin-right

Here's a functional CSS rule:

- ml1 = `margin-left: 10px`
- mr1 = `margin-right: 10px`

Here's someone else's functional CSS rule:

- mgl10 = `margin-left: 10px`
- mgr10 = `margin-right: 10px`

Whilst I prefer the first functional classes, mapping between the two sets of preons will be easy when preons are like this:

```yaml
- label: ml
  css-property: margin-left
  rule:
    - scaled
    - special-sizes
    - percentaged
    - discrete
    - negative-scaled
```

### Why do I want to map these? The answer is, componentizing the web

Say I have a simple card component:

```html
<div class="pa2 bg-grey-light">
  <h3 class="fs3 lh2 fwb mb2">My headline</h3>
  <img class="w-100 mb2" src="image.png" />
  <p class="fs1 lh1">
    Some short description that is part of the card
  </p>
</div>
```

I can now, using the base functional classes, the preon rules and the CSS property names, I can convert to a different syntax. So if my rules are different to a component created with another functional CSS library, no worries. We can convert; more easily if there is a config, and preons will already have that.

So a different markup style could be:

```html
<div class="pada2 bg-lightgrey">
  <h3 class="fontsize3 lineh2 fontwbold mgb2">My headline</h3>
  <img class="width-100 mb2" src="image.png" />
  <p class="fontsize1 lineh1">
    Some short description that is part of the card
  </p>
</div>
```

## Licence/License

I decided to use GPLv2.1. I like that it encourages free use of software. "If taken freely, give freely" is the licence motto for this. I take kudos from WordPress and discovered however, that their themes and plugins operate under the same GPLv2.1 domain as a derivative work.

It made me think, can someone insist a commercial plugin be made free? I don't know the answer to that but I don't want to prevent developers from not being able to commercialize Preons as part of a large piece of work.

### Readme notice

You are free to modify and do as you choose to this library however, it uses [GPLv2.1](#LICENSE) to keep it free. Of course, you can commercialize your product where this library is part of a larger piece of work and is merely a dependency.

## CSS Properties

What didn't make the cut:

- background
- border-top, border-bottom, border-left, border-right
- filter
- font
- font-variant
- list-style
- list-style-image
- list-style-position

These are properties that have lots of rules applied to them as a catch-all CSS property. For instance, border-top has border style, width and color. This in my humble opinion, goes against the principle of functional CSS and the number of compositions will grow exponentially.

Instead it is more verbose, but more concise to just use each border property separately. If one wants to join these together, I'm still a big fan of using BEM or modules for things like buttons as it helps better to create consistency.

There's nothing stopping developers from using these properties in their own preons config files.

## Typescale

https://type-scale.com/

Perfect 4th is being used as the default scale.

## Finally I understand commander.js sub commands

### What is a sub command

Many CLI tools are much more involved than just one command.

#### There's Git

```bash
$ git init
$ git clone
$ git checkout
$ git add
```

Many of us use these commands everyday.

#### There's Stripe CLI

As a fan of Stripe's documentation, I had to highlight even there CLI is a joy to work with.

```bash
$ stripe login
$ stripe listen
$ strie logs
```

If we think of our commonly used CLI tools, they manage to package a lot of commands in. And I haven't even mentioned [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), [DigitalOcean](https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/). All tools that I use, some more reguarly than others.

### Why I had problems with commander

The first time I used commander js, I read the documentations, but was confused. In fact, I am still confused by the [action handler sub command](https://github.com/tj/commander.js#action-handler-subcommands) description.

> You can add options to a command that uses an action handler. The action handler gets passed a parameter for each argument you declared, and one additional argument which is the command object itself. This command argument has the values for the command-specific options added as properties.

...🤷🏾‍♀️

But the [stand-alone executable (sub)commands](https://github.com/tj/commander.js#stand-alone-executable-subcommands) finally clicked for me. So if you had the same 🤷🏾‍♀️ moment, hopefully this article will help.

### Why do I want to use sub commands

Off the top of my head, for preons, I see that already there needs to be:

- A config-to-scss generator command
- A config-to-css generator command
- A documentations generator command
- A class reference generator command
- A components html generator command

And so I want the commands to look like `preon stylesheet` or `preon stylesheet --scss` etc. In this istance, tt would make sense that the default generates plain old CSS, but all other types can be created as well. I want Preons to be agnostic to CSS compilers of choice.

### How to create sub commands

So the sub commands in commander js go like this.

Create a cli command file called `myfile`:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

const json = require("../../package.json");

const { program } = require("commander");
program.version(json.version);

program.command("stylesheet", "Generates a stylesheet");

program.parse(process.argv);
```

Ensure you have execute permissions on that file.

```bash
chmod +x myfile
```

In the same folder, create another separate command with the name, `myfile-stylesheet`.

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

const program = require("commander");

program.option("-s, --scss", "scss").parse(process.argv);
```

Again, add execute permissions.

```bash
chmod +x myfile-stylesheet
```

And that's it. You now are able to route that `program.command` to the next CLI tool as a sub command.

```bash
myfile stylesheet --scss
```

Of course, you are well within your rights to call that file directly.

## How to distribute the preons theme

### Whitelist first

> Tip: instead of blacklisting files and folders in .npmignore, whitelist them in the &quot;files&quot; field in package.json.
> &mdash; Dan Abramov (@dan_abramov)

So I almost was going to use .npmignore but discovered that `files` array lets me only include what I want to distribute to npm.

> https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#files

### npm publish

> https://itnext.io/step-by-step-building-and-publishing-an-npm-typescript-package-44fe7164964c

Running `npm publish` did something interesting. It ran the `script.prepare` hook in the package.json. So I am able to build the `preons.css` and `preons.scss` before it publishes.

```bash

> preons@0.0.1 prepare /Users/gemma/Workspace/preons
> src/console/preons stylesheet > dist/preons.css && src/console/preons stylesheet --scss > dist/preons.scss

npm notice
npm notice 📦  preons@0.0.1
npm notice === Tarball Contents ===
npm notice 1.2kB   package.json
npm notice 3.6kB   CHANGELOG.md
npm notice 26.5kB  LICENSE

npm notice 7.2kB   dist/reset.css

```

### Automatically publishing to npm

> https://intuit.github.io/auto/plugins/npm/README.html

```
yarn add -D @auto-it/npm
```

#### Prerequisites

"To publish to npm you will need an NPM_TOKEN set in your environment."

https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-authentication-tokens

#### Manually add it to the .autorc

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "npm",
    // or with options
    ["npm", { "forcePublish": false }]
    // other plugins
  ]
}
```

## The Preons CLI

First pass looks like this. It doesn't work perfectly but it's good.

```bash
Usage: preons [options] [command]

Options:
  -V, --version      output the version number
  -h, --help         display help for command

Commands:
  stylesheet [name]  Generates a stylesheet
  help [command]     display help for command
```

```bash
Usage: preons-stylesheet [options]

Options:
  -s, --scss   Scss stylesheet
  -c, --css    CSS stylesheet
  -i, --input  File of custom rules yaml
  -h, --help   display help for command
```

## Config first approach

_todo_

## Experimental Mode

Following the Semver conventions in Issue [363](https://github.com/semver/semver/issues/363).

### 0.y.z

During experimental mode, 0.y.z means "0.MAJOR.MINOR".

"This is when you first start to apply SemVer principles: you are still in the 'privileged' 0.y.z range, but you already start to distinguish between breaking and non-breaking changes."

I may have started SemVer too early then, as the features aren't fully formed. So I will stay at v0.3.0 instead and only do interations of this kind:

### 0.3.z

"In this phase it really means "0.3.MAJOR". Ie. things are generally expected to work
but anything can break with any upgrade."

I will thus commit with `fix: ....` instead until the main features are there.

## No node-sass, just sass

Why?

Node-sass across different environments is a point of never ending pain for me. I don't know, but having to quite regularly do `rebuild node-sass` highlights there's a problem that has not been solved.

I then discovered this:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass

A pure javascript implementation for sass, compiled down from Dart.

## What is GPG

```bash
18 error Command failed: git tag v0.3.8 -sm Bump version to: 0.3.8 [skip ci]
18 error error: cannot run gpg: No such file or directory
18 error error: gpg failed to sign the data
18 error error: unable to sign the tag
19 verbose exit [ 1, true ]
```

Running `npm run release` keeps generating the following error.
