## Document all CSS rules

My thinking is, if I create a config of all CSS property names (or at least the most used ones), it's not that difficult to map preons rules to them. Then, any component made with any preon rule can be converted. Therefore, different companies, teams and people can use functional class syntax that they are most comfortable with.

As I'm probably not making any sense, here's an example.

CSS Property Names (some):

- margin-left
- margin-right

Here's a functional CSS rule:

- ml1 = `margin-left: 10px`
- mr1 = `margin-right: 10px`

Here's someone else's functional CSS rule:

- mgl10 = `margin-left: 10px`
- mgr10 = `margin-right: 10px`

Whilst I prefer the first functional classes, mapping between the two sets of preons will be easy when preons are like this:

```yaml
- label: ml
  css-property: margin-left
  rule:
    - scaled
    - special-sizes
    - percentaged
    - discrete
    - negative-scaled
```

### Why do I want to map these? The answer is, componentizing the web

Say I have a simple card component:

```html
<div class="pa2 bg-grey-light">
    <h3 class="fs3 lh2 fwb mb2">My headline</h3>
    <img class="w-100 mb2" src="image.png" />
    <p class="fs1 lh1">
        Some short description that is part of the card
    </p>
</div>
```

I can now, using the base functional classes, the preon rules and the CSS property names, I can convert to a different syntax. So if my rules are different to a component created with another functional CSS library, no worries. We can convert; more easily if there is a config, and preons will already have that.

So a different markup style could be:

```html
<div class="pada2 bg-lightgrey">
    <h3 class="fontsize3 lineh2 fontwbold mgb2">My headline</h3>
    <img class="width-100 mb2" src="image.png" />
    <p class="fontsize1 lineh1">
        Some short description that is part of the card
    </p>
</div>
```
